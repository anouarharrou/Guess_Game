# Guess Game
This's a Guess Number Game with PHP.

The goal of this project is to make a little game in which we will try to guess a number
randomly generated by your php script.

2nd php page that will retrieve user input generate a random number
according to the chosen difficulty, and gives the hand to the player to guess the number.
After each riddle an indication will display to the user.
which is if the number is near or far to the target.

Each difficulty involves: 

• Easy: a random number between 1 and 10, with 5 tries

• Average: a random number between 1 and 50, with 10 tries

• Difficult: a random number between 1 and 100, with 20 tries

The game ends in one of two cases: 

• The player manages to guess the number

• The number of tries available is used by the player
